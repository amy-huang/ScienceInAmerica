Is the constitution of academia shifting? Humanities researchers are still 3 times more likely to work at a university than anywhere else. Engineers are still 5 times more likely to go corporate than academic. On the flip side, students in the life sciences were twice as likely to go into academia than industry 10 years ago, but now about 40% of them go into each. The opposite is true for mathematics and computer sciences students today. In 1996, nearly all graduates were equally likely to go into academia or industry; today, they're twice as likely to work for corporations - with only 30% electing to stay in the ivory tower. Education degree holders show an opposing trend, with 10% more graduates funneling into academia than before.
