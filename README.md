# ScienceInAmerica
A series of HTML visualizations of big organization research in the United States.

# Intro

Science is fundamental to innovation. Each generation knows more about why and how the world works, and is able to do more with that knowledge than ever before. 

In particular, computer science research has been crucial in driving technological growth in recent years. The internet was a Department of Defense research project. Hyperlinked webpages was a university one, and so was Google. Research doesn't drive all technological innovation - entrepreneurship is also central - but it does do important work making it possible. Answering questions like "What's the best way to do this? What's important to work on in this subfield? How can we do it better?" paves the way for corporations and other entities to turn ideas into action on a large scale.

Let's look further into this process. Science, broadly put, is the creation of new knowledge in a standardized way - if people agree that it's science, it's science. How this is done affects greater society in how people think about truth and knowledge, with significant implications in politics, culture, and economy.

# Who

Scientists do science, and they are almost always trained in graduate school. 

Funded by large organizations.

# What 

Different fields of study based on resource bundling.

# Why

Applications for the betterment of society - controversies, criticism.

# Todo

This project will attempt to explain in words and with web visualizations why and how that happens. I will cover
- what fields count as "science"
- how scientists, engineers, and technicians are educated
- who the major funding organizations are
- the government's fluctuating role in giving funding and direction
- universities as the current centers for research, and the other kinds of places for research
- what the process of doing research is like 
- what research is like in computer science specifically, and why it is so special
