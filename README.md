# blurb

Science is fundamental to innovation. Each generation knows more about why and how the world works, and is able to do more with that knowledge than ever before. 

In recent years, computer science research in particular has become invaluable in daily life. The internet was a Department of Defense research project. Hyperlinked webpages was a university one, and so was Google. Today, research does not drive all technological innovation or even its daily maintenance, but it did (and still does) crucial work in making it possible. 




This project will attempt to explain in words and with web visualizations why and how that happens. I will cover
- what fields count as "science"
- how scientists, engineers, and technicians are educated
- who the major funding organizations are
- the government's fluctuating role in giving funding and direction
- universities as the current centers for research, and the other kinds of places for research
- what the process of doing research is like 
- what research is like in computer science specifically, and why it is so special
