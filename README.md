# ScienceInAmerica
A series of HTML visualizations of big organization research in the United States.

Scientists, and the work that they do, often feels disparate from mainstream American life. They write our textbooks, publish the statistics that we see in government brochures and agency websites, and teach many of the college students in the country. We don't see them around - unless we have scientific affiliations around. They don't seem to like the spotlight, either; they're hardly in the media.

Who are they, and where are they? What do they do all day? Who gives them money, and what do those people and organizations look like? These are odd questions for sure - it's much like wondering who manufactures the eraser tips on your pencils, or the plastic in your phone case. You never have to think about it much.

That isn't to say, though, that it can't be interesting. In recent years, computer science research in particular has become crucial in the development of computer technologies that have become inextricable from daily life. The internet was a Department of Defense research project. Hyperlinked webpages were a university one, and so was Google. Today, research does not drive all technological innovation or even its daily maintenance, but it did (and still does) crucial work in making it possible.

This project will attempt to explain in words and with web visualizations why and how that happens. I will cover
- what fields count as "science"
- how scientists, engineers, and technicians are educated
- who the major funding organizations are
- the government's fluctuating role in giving funding and direction
- universities as the current centers for research, and the other kinds of places for research
- what the process of doing research is like 
- what research is like in computer science specifically, and why it is so special
